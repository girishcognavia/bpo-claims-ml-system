- **Real-time claim screening and optimization**

## 📊 System Overview

The system acts as an intelligent intermediary that:
1. **Receives raw clinical data** from healthcare providers
2. **Processes and enhances claims** using ML-driven insights
3. **Predicts approval probability** before submission
4. **Provides actionable recommendations** to improve success rates
5. **Optimizes submission timing** and claim routing
